		<p>Not long after we met, we've already had our first voice call. I was attending the debut of Randall's sister at the time. I was very nervous. I knew nobody there and there was that 5 year old brother and sister that french kissed infront of me. I hid in the storage room of the venue and you were active. I asked to call. My ass was sweating. We barely knew each other and I already asked to call. But you said yes. You barely knew me but you said yes. I enjoyed the call so much. So much so that I started telling all my friends about it. I think I started developing a feeling for you</p>
