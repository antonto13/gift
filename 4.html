		<p>Yes. The pun as intended. This vc was much shorter and surprisingly more awkward than the first vc. Nobody said anything for a really long time. Then out of nowhere, I pulled my bass out of my ass then started playing. Eventually you started playing too. We went back and forth but unfortunately the vc was cut short because I had to leave. Since then, our jamming sessions have gotten better. To the point where I play guitar while you sing. But this day marks the very first ever jamming session. And I will never forget it. Besides. This was also when I was certain I fell for you</p>
