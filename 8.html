		<p>That day, you listed down the reasons of why your day went well. One of those reasons was "talking to me". I couldn't hide it anymore. I wanted to tell you how I felt about you. I was scared. Not of getting rejected, but of how you'd react. Out of all the outcomes I thought of, I did not expect you to like me back. I was definetly surprised. But I was happy. I almost couldn't sleep at all that night. I was so happy. I told all of my friends about it. To think that someone as amazing and beautiful and smart as you would like me back â™¡</p>
